# Chronic-Kidney-Desease-Prediction
In this research, we used
classifiers such as the Support Vector Machine, the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (kNN),
and the Decision Tree to try to predict CKD. We obtained 98.33% accuracy for SVM, 97.5%
accuracy for KNN, and 95.83% accuracy for decision tree as a consequence of our research.
